# grade-calc

What your project is/does (and what it's called): It's a grade calculator, and... it's called "Grade Calculator" ðŸ’€ You can input weighted grades, and it will calculate your final grade. and my website will tell you what you need to score in the remaining weighted section to end with your target grade using a slider. 

Why you made your project: I made it because I keep coding for hack club instead of doing my hw (oops) and I find myself constantly checking and mental mathing my grades (EVEN THOUGH I COULD JUST STUDY FOR TESTS); This project was mostly inspired off of that.

How you made your project: I made it in VS Code using html, js, and css. I also had to search some things up like sliders.

What you struggled with and what you learned: I struggled with a lot of bugs, and getting the slider and the buttons working was really annnoying honestly. I feel like I could've made this more aesthetic but seeing as not doing this earlier let me bring up my grades, I'd say it was worth it. (This is about grades after all)

Also there were SO MANY TYPOS which I had to CONSTANTLY FIX
